# SiliconBurmuin Project Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the SiliconBurmuin project repository, a collaborative initiative under the IKERLAN23ELKARTEK program focused on advancing neuromorphic technology research and applications. This repository is dedicated to the contributions of Biocruces Bizkaia, showcasing our efforts in leveraging cutting-edge neuromorphic computing technologies to address complex challenges in healthcare and biomedical research.

## Project Description

SiliconBurmuin aims to bridge the gap between computational neuroscience and practical technological applications, with a special emphasis on health-related innovations. Our work at Biocruces Bizkaia within this project spans various facets, including the development of algorithms, prototypes, and tools that are inspired by the principles of neural operation and designed to improve healthcare outcomes.

23/02/2024: To the date, the repository contains PsychoPy experyments which are still under construction. They do not include any evaluation of the metrics obtained, but rather the skeleton/logic of the experiment itself. These exercises are meant to familiarize with the toolbox, and as experiments are selected for testing on patients, they will be completed.

## Contents

This repository contains:
- **Code**: [UNDER CONSTRUCTION] Source code for PsychoPy experyments and tools developed as part of our research.
- **Files**: Generated CAD files or similar.
- **Documentation**: [UNDER CONSTRUCTION] Detailed explanations of the methodologies, implementation details, and usage instructions for our developments.
- **Publications**: [UNDER CONSTRUCTION] Links to published research papers, posters, and other academic outputs deriving from this project.
